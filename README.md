# chrome-bookmark-share
Sync bookmark folders across different users.
*Currently under construction*
## Use Case 1:
You have more than one Chrome profile, one for work and home. You want to keep these accounts separate and the Bookmarks Bar different, but collect tools for your job in a folder. Bookmark folder sync would keep both up to date.
## Use Case 2:
You're working on a project with your team or significant other and want to keep relevant links in one place natively in Chrome.
